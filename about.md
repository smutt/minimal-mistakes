Metafarce is a place where I can record things I think about.  I don't like the term blog too much as it sounds rather narcissistic.  This is not meant to be a journal or an account of my life.  I use Metafarce as a place where I can explore topics that interest me, but that will also hopefully interest the reader.

### About Me
I am a Master's student in the I School at UC Berkeley where I focus on technology and public policy.  It's a diverse place, and my interests are varied, so expect metafarce to be eclectic.  Previously I worked for about 15 years in the software development industry specializing in computer networking and communications.
