I swore I would never have a blog. I find most of them to be full of navel gazing and narcissism. Who cares about what I ate today or how many times I took a shit yesterday?  It's uninteresting and a waste of time.

So I promise my readership that I will provide thoughtful and hopefully entertaining critiques of contemporary subjects.  There will be no discussions of me or my needs,  wants, desires, whims and dreams.  Instead, by relying on a tradition much older than the internet, I will disassociate myself from the analysis I provide.  Thereby limiting the  intention of every article I write to education and intellectual stimulation.
