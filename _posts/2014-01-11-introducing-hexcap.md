This week I put together a website and released version 0.1 of Hexcap, a project I have been working on for a few months in my spare time.  Hexcap is an interactive hex editor for libpcap files.  My goals with Hexcap are to create a general purpose packet editor that allows network engineers to generate, edit and send packets all from within Hexcap.  With version 0.1 Hexcap can open captures created with tcpdump, edit the capture and save it again.  So while even if it doesn't support that many protocols yet it's a solid start.
